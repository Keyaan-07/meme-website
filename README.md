# meme-website


this is a small project written in python and HTML that makes a website that shows random meme from reddit and also it's repositories. It makes use of the [meme api](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api) by D3vd. Flask Microframework is also used.

## working
first, the python calls the API. which sends data in JSON. it is parsed into 'subreddit' and 'meme_pic'. then they are displayed over onto the HTML webpage. i've also added a little bit of CSS.
